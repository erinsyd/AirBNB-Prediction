# AirBNB-Prediction
This is a university assignment that aims to predict the price of a house listed on AirBNB by analyzing its attributes, 
such as the number of bedrooms, location, and historical data. Exploratory data analysis is used to analyze and select 
appropriate variables, machine learning algorithms are applied to build prediction models, and techniques such as lassoing 
and ridging are incorporated to avoid overfitting and improve the prediction accuracy of the models.
